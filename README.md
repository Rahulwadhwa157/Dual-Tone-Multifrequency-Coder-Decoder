# Dual-Tone-Multifrequency-Coder-Decoder
•Designed GUI Version of a DTMF. It allows the users to dial any string of codes he wanted to transmit at reciever's
side. The strinf of codes were mapped to Real Time Domain Signals and user has full control on channel parameters,
Filter Prameters.
•At reciever's end efficiently decoded the Signal back to String of Codes. Accuracy of decoding depends on the Noise
level and was close to 100% for Gaussian noise upto Variance=15.
•Used MATLAB functionalities to implement it in a Graphical user interface making it possible for user to avoid
command line and more user friendly.
